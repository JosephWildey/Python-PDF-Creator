# Python-PDF-Creator
Yet another simple Python editor that can export text and an image into a PDF file. This one uses Tkinter instead of PyGTK. It also uses PyPDF to generate the PDFs, and PIL to handle images.

Future plans will add more functionality. It's very basic at the moment. Type text, load in an image, save a single page PDF.

This has only been tested on Fedora.
